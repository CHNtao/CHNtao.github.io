I am now working at school of computer science and engineering (school of artificial intelligence), Chongqing University of Science and Thchnology, Chongqing, China.

- ðŸ’» My major is **Computer Science and Technology**.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on brain-inspired computing and memristor neural network, in particular spiking neural network and neural coding. I have published some papers in the IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems (TCDS), Knowledge-Based Systems (KBS), Cognitive Neurodynamics (CODY) and Neurocomputing.
